===========
Compressure was a project for me to get back into writing Java, and explore a topic that I 
found interesting during my CS courses.  It is a compression application for text files.  
I explore the basics of lossless compression and do some analysis on the Compressure application.  



<a class="page-link" href="{{ "/projects/julia-fe" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Julia-FE</a>
===========
After using finite element codes for a while I wanted to get my hands dirty and build one from scratch. 
This implementation is written in Julia, using GMSH for meshing, and solves Poisson's equation.
I wrote this as practical guide to bridge the gap between concepts and implementation in a clear and 
accessible manner.
