I'm a computational physicist working with [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](http://www.ornl.gov/) in the Computer Science and Mathematics Department.  Currently I am working on the Eclipse Integrated Computational Environment developed at ORNL, sponsored by the Eclipse foundation.  Specifically I am developing infrastructure for climate and battery simulations.  

I have degrees in physics and mathematics from the [University of Wisconsin at La Crosse](http://www.uwlax.edu).  I am interested in all aspects of computational science.  Primarily my homegrown projects are simulations of toy systems (due to hardware limitations) often employing cellular automata and MCMC like methods.  

Outside of science and technology I enjoy hiking, cooking, and most forms of art.  You'll probably see a number of posts on these subjects sprinkled throughout the sciency things.  I'll try to keep everything tagged nicely so that you can skip parts that you don't like.

For more information or an updated resume send me an email (link at the bottom of the page).
