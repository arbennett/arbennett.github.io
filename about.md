I'm a post-baccalaureate researcher working with Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
My research is at the intersection of software, computational science, and
climate science.  There are two big projects that I am a part of (ICE and
LIVVkit), as well as numerous other small projects and excursions.  Check out
my github page to see what I've been working on. 

Outside of science and technology I enjoy hiking, cooking, and most forms of art.  
You'll probably see a number of posts on these subjects sprinkled throughout the sciency things.  
I'll try to keep everything tagged nicely so that you can skip parts that you don't like.
