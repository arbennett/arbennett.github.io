I'm a graduate student in the Compuational Hydrology group in the Department of 
Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Washington.  I'm 
interested in computational science and humanity's impact on the Earth system.

I'm bad at keeping these things current, so the more vague the better.
If you want to know more, contact me!
