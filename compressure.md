title: Huffman Coding with Compressure
permalink: /projects/compressure/
---

Introduction 
============
basic explanation of compression algorithms, lossy vs lossless

Huffman Encoding
================
talk about building the huffman tree and writing the encoding

Huffman Decoding
================
talk about writing a header and how to rebuild the huffman tree or code mapping

Java Implementation
===================
needing to write the bitreader/writer since java normally handles things as bytes

Analysis
========
show differences between random symbols, regular text, and compare to tar

Conclusion
==========
Say something about adaptive huffman encoding and other improvements like lzq

References
==========
[1] the internet

Another header
==============
Hopefully this gives me a scrollbar
