Introduction 
============
basic explanation of genetic algorithms + disclaimer that I'm only using a parent vs child hillclimber

Fitness Function
================
how do we compare generations

Python Implementation
================
basics

Analysis
========
show some pictures and a couple graphs

Conclusion
==========
Talk about how to implement a real genetic algorithm, maybe talk about parallelization for speedups
