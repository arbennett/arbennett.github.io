With the announcement of Github pages moving to Jekyll 3.0 I have moved the site to 
Kramdown instead of Rdiscount for my markdown syntax.  This may cause funky 
things with older posts.  I've tried to go through and catch them, but some may 
have slipped.  If you see anything feel free to email me or submit an issue on 
the pages repo.
