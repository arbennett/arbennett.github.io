It's as easy as 
\\[ \frac{1}{\pi} = \frac{2 \sqrt 2}{9801} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(4k)!(1103+26390k)}{k!^4(396^{4k})} \\]

Just add the following snippet to your head tag:

{% highlight html %}
<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>
{% endhighlight %}

And then type away.
