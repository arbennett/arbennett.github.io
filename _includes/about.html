<div class='about'>
I'm a graduate student in the Compuational Hydrology group in the Department of
Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Washington. Previously
I worked at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the Computer Science and Math
department.  My research focuses on hydrologic model development and evaluation.  I hope to
improve our understanding of large scale hydrologic systems through information theory.
